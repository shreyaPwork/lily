## Current Status

### âœ… Completed Tasks
1. **Project Initialization**: Next.js project with TypeScript
2. **Dependency Management**: All packages installed successfully
3. **Folder Structure**: Complete organization established
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive memory bank created
5. **Tech Stack Selection**: Modern, scalable technologies chosen

### ðŸ”„ In Progress Tasks
1. **Supabase Setup**: Database configuration and schema design
2. **Environment Configuration**: Secure variable management
3. **TypeScript Enhancement**: Path aliases and strict typing

### ðŸ“… Upcoming Tasks
1. **UI Component Library**: Shadcn/ui integration
2. **Authentication System**: Customer and admin auth flows
3. **Database Schema**: Core ecommerce tables
4. **API Routes**: Next.js backend endpoints
5. **State Management**: Zustand and React Query setup

## Known Issues
- None currently identified (project in initial setup phase)

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Decisions (Confirmed)
- **Next.js 14**: Chosen for modern React features and performance
- **Supabase**: Selected for rapid backend development
- **TypeScript**: Implemented for type safety and better DX
- **Tailwind CSS**: Adopted for rapid UI development
- **Unified Codebase**: Single project for customer and admin interfaces

### Refined Decisions
- **Route Organization**: Using Next.js route groups for clear separation
- **Component Architecture**: Atomic design pattern with Shadcn/ui
- **State Management**: Zustand for client state, React Query for server state
- **Deployment Strategy**: Static export for Hostinger compatibility

### Future Considerations
- **Performance Monitoring**: Implement Core Web Vitals tracking
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundary system
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit and integration testing approach
- **Scaling Strategy**: Database optimization and caching

## Success Metrics Tracking

### Development Metrics
- **Setup Time**: âœ… Completed in planned timeframe
- **Dependency Conflicts**: âœ… None encountered
- **Documentation Quality**: âœ… Comprehensive memory bank created
- **Code Organization**: âœ… Clean, scalable structure established

### Upcoming Metrics to Track
- **Build Performance**: Bundle size and build time
- **Development Experience**: Hot reload and type checking speed
- **Database Performance**: Query response times
- **User Experience**: Page load times and interactivity

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks
1. **Hostinger Deployment**: Static export limitations with dynamic features
2. **Payment Integration**: API complexity and testing requirements
3. **Performance**: Balancing features with speed requirements
4. **User Experience**: Admin dashboard complexity for non-technical users

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Deployment**: Plan static-friendly architecture from start
2. **Payments**: Use sandbox environments for thorough testing
3. **Performance**: Implement monitoring and optimization early
4. **UX**: Regular user testing and feedback incorporation

## Next Session Priorities
1. Complete Supabase database schema design
2. Set up environment variables and configuration
3. Create foundational UI components
4. Implement basic authentication structure
5. Build initial customer and admin layouts

The project is off to a strong start with solid foundations in place. The next phase focuses on core functionality implementation.
